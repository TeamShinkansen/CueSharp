# CueSharp

CueSharp is an open source cue sheet parser library written in C#.  
  
The cue sheet, simply put, is a text file that stores metadata for extracted audio CDs and data CDs. Cue sheets are typically generated using  [Exact Audio Copy (EAC)](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/ "EAC")  in order to rip your audio CDs perfectly.

## Features at a glance

-   Accurately follows the  [cue sheet specification](https://wyday.com/cuesharp/specification.php "Cue sheet specifcation").
-   Can open cue sheets for wave files and binary data files alike.
-   Easy to use interface to create, open, edit, and save cue sheets.
-   Compiles with .NET 1.1 â€“ 3.5, and Mono.

## What CueSharp Isn't

CueSharp is not a standalone program - if you aren't a developer, then CueSharp isn't for you. Here are a couple of standalone programs that can open and manipulate CueSheets:

-   [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/ "foobar2000"): A freeware audio player for Windows 2000, XP and Vista.
-   [DaemonTools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/ "DaemonTools"): A freeware program for mounting .bin/.cue files to a virtual disc drive.
